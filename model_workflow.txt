Breast Cancer Prediction Model - Workflow

1.  Imported essential libraries:

-   pandas for data handling
-   numpy for numerical operations
-   matplotlib for visualization
-   LabelEncoder for encoding categorical labels
-   MinMaxScaler for feature normalization
-   train_test_split for splitting dataset
-   KMeans for clustering
-   KNeighborsClassifier for classification
-   accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluation

2.  Encoded the ‘diagnosis’ column using LabelEncoder to convert M/B
    into numeric values.

3.  Selected ‘diagnosis’ as the target column and separated the dataset
    into:

-   X: feature variables
-   Y: target labels

4.  Applied MinMaxScaler to normalize all feature values between 0 and
    1.

5.  Split the dataset into training and testing sets using
    train_test_split (80% train, 20% test).

6.  Applied KMeans clustering with 2 clusters to identify underlying
    patterns and added the cluster label as a new feature for both
    training and test datasets.

7.  Trained a KNN classifier (k=5) using the training data including the
    cluster feature.

8.  Predicted outcomes on the test dataset and evaluated model
    performance using:

-   Accuracy
-   Precision
-   Recall
-   F1-score

This workflow demonstrates preprocessing, clustering, classification,
and evaluation steps for building a reliable breast cancer prediction
system.
